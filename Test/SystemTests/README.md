# System Tests

Based on [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-system-testing-and-integration-testing/):

System testing is a type of testing that verifies the software’s behavior and functionality as a whole system.
It is conducted after integration testing and ensures that all the individual components of the system are working together as intended.
The primary goal of system testing is to identify defects in the system and ensure that it meets the requirements and specifications provided.

While developing a software or application product, it is tested at the final stage as a whole by combining all the product modules and this is called as System Testing.
The primary aim of conducting this test is that it must fulfill the customer/user requirement specification.
It is also called an end-to-end test, as is performed at the end of the development.
This testing does not depend on system implementation; in simple words, the system tester doesn’t know which technique between procedural and object-oriented is implemented.
This testing is classified into functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
In functional testing, the testing is similar to black-box testing which is based on specifications instead of code and syntax of the programming language used.
On the other hand, non-functional testing, checks for performance and reliability by generating test cases in the corresponding programming language.
