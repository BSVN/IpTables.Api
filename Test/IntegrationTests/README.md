# Itegration Tests

Based on [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-system-testing-and-integration-testing/):

Integration testing is a type of testing that focuses on verifying the interfaces and interactions between software components or modules.
It is conducted after unit testing and ensures that the individual components are integrated correctly and work together as intended.
The primary goal of integration testing is to identify defects in the interfaces and interactions between software components,
and ensure that the software meets the requirements and specifications provided.

This testing is the collection of the modules of the software,
where the relationship and the interfaces between the different components are also tested.
It needs coordination between the project-level activities of integrating the constituent components at a time.
The integration and integration testing must adhere to a building plan for the defined integration and identification of the bug in the early stages.
However, an integrator or integration tester must have programming knowledge, unlike a system tester.
